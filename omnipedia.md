# Website for Omnipedia

TBD

## Discussion

> Me: You wanted to have a website for your company, right? Can you prepare a repo or repos for it, please?
>
> Michael McCulloch: Oh for sure.
>
> Me: I personally prefer monorepos due to ease of source control and ease of writing code elated to CI/CD.
>
> Michael McCulloch: So, what were you thinking you wanted to build?
>
> Michael McCulloch: Giving you repo access to our repo would require NDAs all around, which seems a bit heavy handed. Would a separate repo for the UI be acceptable?
>
> Me: Either actix or axum  backend and literally whatever for the frontend.
>
> Michael McCulloch: Ah got you.
>
> Me: "Would a separate repo for the UI be acceptable?". Totally!
>
> Michael McCulloch: I would also be willing to prepare a mock API binary for you to test against alternatively, i can provide the api signature snippets and you can build the binary, alternatively I can privide a screenshot of the OpenAPI documentation and you can build something into PostMan.
>
> Micheal McCulloch: And, would you like to build the marketing website, or the chat interface?
>
> Me: That's a question for everyone who would be interested!
>
> Me: I'll need to start my day now. I'll check the Discord later!
>
> Michael McCulloch: Ok, well the marketing website is detached from everything so no api is currently needed. We're using a tool (WebStudio) to build it and it's in a draft state.
>
> Michael McCulloch: The chat UI however would require API Access. I know I would prefer if the hackathon was around the Chat UI, but like you said: "That's a question for everyone who would be interested!".
>
> Michael McCulloch: "build something into PostMan". I will prepare a Postman collection for you today, then you can do as you wish. Let me know what the group decides.
