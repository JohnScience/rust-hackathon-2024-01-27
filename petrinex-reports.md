**Warning: the problem is unstructured and requires communication with the person who submitted it**.

Every oil and gas company in Alberta is required to submit a monthly report to the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) that details the amount of oil, gas, and water produced from each well.

Petrinex is an online system for volumetric reporting, used by B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan.

Facility operators, royalty taxpayers and oil purchasers from reporting facilities may be subject to penalties and interest if they do not meet their reporting requirements.

However, there can be false positives.

**TODO:** Brush up on the topic of false positives.

Enhanced Production Audit Program (EPAP) helps companies comply with our requirements and supports our compliance assurance program. Created through Directive 076: Operator Declaration Regarding Measurement and Reporting, EPAP

* encourages operators to improve their measurement and reporting processes, which leads to greater compliance and may reduce the number of noncompliances that we find in field inspections and audits; and
* helps operators avoid the costs related to enforcement activities created by Directive 019: Compliance Assurance—Enforcement [Rescinded by Manual 013: Compliance and Enforcement Program].

EPAP can be accessed through Petrinex.
